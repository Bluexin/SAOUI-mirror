This is a branch of the <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2205710-sword-art-online-ui-mod-by-thejackimonster">SAO UI by TheJackyMonster</a>.
I used his version 1.5 (for minecraft 1.8) as base (for version 1.0)

#Planned:
 * admin-style ui for creative mode (<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2371404-sword-art-online-ui-mod-continuation-by-mmmgames?comment=110">Link</a>)
 * make the ui open on drag down? (low priority)
 * theme-pack support?


#Legal stuff:
The code is public. By that I mean anyone willing to read it, both to understand the mechanics of this mod, any rendering in general, or to learn how things work is freely able to.
But please, don't just rip things off. That won't help you understanding what you do (making the debug/maintaining/... process tedious, and there isn't any merit in claiming other people's work yours.
The images however can't be re-used. By this I specify you <b>don't have permission</b> to use the textures (or any resource) for your own.
