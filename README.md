# SAOUI 

This is a branch of the <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2205710-sword-art-online-ui-mod-by-thejackimonster">SAO UI by TheJackyMonster</a>.
I used his version 1.5 (for minecraft 1.8) as base (for version 1.0)


Planned:
 * flower-ish render for the crystal above an entity's head
 * admin-style ui for creative mode (<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2371404-sword-art-online-ui-mod-continuation-by-mmmgames?comment=110">Link</a>)
 * make the ui open on drag down? (low priority)
 * changes to the rendering of "sims crystals" and health bars (only players/aggressive mobs/hurt passive)
